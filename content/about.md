Kia ora

My name's Lee Durbin, and I'm a data analyst. I live in Aotearoa New Zealand, and I currently work for [Auckland Libraries](https://www.aucklandlibraries.govt.nz/) as a data analyst.

I was born and raised in Wales (in a little town called Ystrad Rhondda), and I studied English Literature at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels whilst at [The University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/)
